                    Harry Potter is a series of seven fantacy novels written by British author <b>J. K. Rowling.</b>
                        The films are imaginative, adventures, funny, frightening and <b>magical!</b>
                        What makes them so successful is that they combine action, fantasy and friendship.
                        The books and movies popularized the fantasy genre among children and young adult.
                        The main character is kind, brave, helpful and intelligent. Harry is also friendly and has many friends. He is not frightened of his enemies. This is why Harry Potter is so famous.
                        The series has eight fantasy parts, beginning with <b>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</b> and culminating with <b>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part2</b>.
